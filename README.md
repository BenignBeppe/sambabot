# sambabot
Sambabot is score writer and player, written in Javascript and HTML. It was created as a way to study, listen to and create samba breaks, but can probably be used for other music too.

A demo of Sambabot can be found at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14003962/sambabot/index.html. This page will however change as development continues and may break without notice.
